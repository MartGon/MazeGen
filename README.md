# MazeGen

MazeGen is a simple game that consists in solving labyrinths that have been procedurally generated.

You can choose to solve the maze the way you like. You can solve the maze by choosing a top view which will allow you to see the whole maze, or choose the first person view that will inmerse you in the game. You can swap between this views whenever you like. There's also a *fog mode* that only allows you to see in top view the portions of the maze that you have already visited.
